# Fireworks

At the press of a button, causes fireworks to erupt from the bottom of the
screen.

## Idea
The idea is to create and HTML canvas that spans over the entire viewport
and then have circles animate upwards with a trail and after some period
of time delete themselves and create an explosion effect

## TODO
- [ ] Make code readable
- [ ] Break into multiple files
- [ ] Fix GC issues, stuttering after many objects have been deleted
